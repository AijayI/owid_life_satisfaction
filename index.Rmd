## Advanced (Optional) ðŸ“ˆ

The following chart demonstrates that it is possible to approximate the functionality of our World in Data grapher for multicountry selection using R, specifically with the `crosstalk` package and a small amount of custom JavaScript. For more information on how to achieve this, see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67058016/how-to-set-default-values-in-filter-select-in-crosstalk-in-r-plotly).


```{r}
pacman::p_load(crosstalk)


# Crosstalk shared data
shared_happy <- highlight_key(happy)

happy_plotly <- plot_ly(
  shared_happy, 
  x = ~Year, 
  y = ~`Happiness: Happy (aggregate)`, 
  color = ~Country, 
  type = "scatter", 
  mode = "lines+markers"
) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(range = c(0, 100)))


country_filter <- filter_select(
  "country_filter", 
  "Select a country to examine", 
  shared_happy, 
  ~Country, 
  multiple = TRUE
)

bscols(
  list(country_filter, happy_plotly)
)
```

<script>
function filter_default() {
  var default_countries = ["Canada", "Australia", "Switzerland", "United States", "Denmark"]; // Set default countries here
  document.getElementById("country_filter").getElementsByClassName("selectized")[0].selectize.setValue(default_countries, false);
}
window.onload = filter_default;
</script>
